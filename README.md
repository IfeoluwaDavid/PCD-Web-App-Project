# Parts Crib Database - Web Application Project.

My final college year project. An  online web and  mobile application used by laboratory technicians and students for managing records of equipment rentals during engineering lab sessions. The application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP. It also has a mobile application built for Android using Java. Both mobile and web applications  utilize the  same MySQL database. Features include: User registration and authentication, item rental and returns, inventory updates etc.
